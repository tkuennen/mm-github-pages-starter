# Vertical Backup

After a recent rewiring project at home, I found that downloads were crawling via a specific wall port in the house. Unfortunately this port also happens to be in my office and is probably the most used Ethernet port in the house outside of the patch panel. Suspecting an incorrectly wired keystone jack or a kink in the wire, I wanted to test that this was the issue prior to tracing cables as this can be a time consuming process with lots of crawling around in the attic. I've used iperf in the past so I thought I would give it a try on macOS High Sierra.
